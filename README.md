# JS-server

This project was created during my 5th semester at mz university, I've been planning on making an own server to server my little home project of creating and sharing IT Security related memo cards. These memo cards contain short tips, or larger tutorials in a format that closelz resembles that of Anki packages.

The project uses the Express framework on top of Nodejs, and let's the user create and account, upload decks, or download them without an account. This is a very simple application but can be (and hopefully will be) expanded to a wider public.
